    "Traditional Object Detection models (like YOLO) tell us *what* an object is but fail to answer *where* it is in 3D space. For a visually impaired person, knowing \"there is a car\" is useless without knowing if it is **50 meters away (Safe)** or **2 meters away (Danger)**.\n",

    "**VisionMate** solves this by combining state-of-the-art Computer Vision models to create a \"Smart Blind Spot Monitor\" that runs on standard camera hardware (no expensive LiDAR required).\n",

    "One of the key challenges in monocular depth estimation is that the output is \"unitless\" (relative intensity 0-255). To solve this, we implemented a **Calibration Protocol**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We measured a reference object (Person) at a known distance (approx. 2 meters).\n",
    "2.  We derived a **Calibration Constant (K = 250)** that maps the model's intensity score to real-world meters.\n",
